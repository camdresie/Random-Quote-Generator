This is the first project I completed for the Full Stack Javascript Techdegree from Treehouse. The project takes in an array of quotes 
with information pertinent to those quotes (who said it, where they said it, when they said it, and a category for the quote). 
The function in the program then randomizes the quotes and selects one. As it does this, the background color for the page changes to a random color.
If a user doesn't hit the button to get a random quote within ten seconds, the page will automatically select a new random quote.
